# Tech Challenge tech11

The task describes a fictive story that you should implement in **JavaScript** with ES6 and Web Components. Your solution should run on Chrome and Firefox. Furthermore, your solution should have **no dependencies to any JavaScript library** (only Standard JavaScript / ES6; #useThePlatform).
But of course, as usual when defining rules, there are exceptions : the library lit-html can/should be used).
